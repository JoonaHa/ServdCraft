#### Web application for managing user access for your game servers

##### In Progress. These specs can and will change drastically

Idea is based on a need for a managing system for whitelisting users for Minecraft servers.
Users can register and add their ingame usernames under their account. Users need to send a request to get a acess on the server. User can have one or more ingame account and all of them have separate permissions.
